The project is a custom GUI (Graphical User Interface) application task. 
It requires integrating a PDF renderer with a coordinate-tracking system. 
Technically, it is feasible using Python libraries that handle PDFs as images (rasterization) or vector objects. Success depends on the tool's ability to map a mouse click on a screen to a specific set of coordinates and then trigger a data-entry event.
